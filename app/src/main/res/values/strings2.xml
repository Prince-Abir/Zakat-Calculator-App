    <string name="Details1"> Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (saws) sent Mu`adh to Yemen and said, Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah"s Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor </string>
    <string name="Details2">  Narrated Abu Aiyub: A man said to the Prophet Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise. The people said, What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him? The Prophet said, He has something to ask. (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin. (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).  </string>
    <string name="Details3">  Narrated Abu Huraira: A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan. The Bedouin said, By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this. When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man. Narrated Abu Zura: From the Prophet the same as above.  </string>
    <string name="Details4">  Narrated Ibn `Abbas: A delegation of the tribe of `Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, O Allah"s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi`a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind. The Prophet said, I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay onefifth of the booty in Allah"s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).  </string>
    <string name="Details5">  Narrated Abu Huraira: When Allah"s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), `Umar, said to Abu Bakr, How can you fight with these people although Allah"s Apostle said,I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah. </string>
    <string name="Details6">  Abu Bakr said, By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah"s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah"s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it Then `Umar said, By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr"s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right. </string>
    <string name="Details7">  Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah: I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet for offering prayer perfectly, giving Zakat, and giving good advice to every Muslim. </string>
    <string name="Details8">  Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, (On the Day of Resurrection) camels will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the world), and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they would tread him with their feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had in the world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with their hooves and would butt him with their horns. The Prophet added, One of their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them. The Prophet added, I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say,O Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him.I can"t help you, for I conveyed Allah"s Message to you.Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say O Muhammad! (please intercede for me). I will say to him, I can"t help you for I conveyed Allah"s message to you.  </string>
    <string name="Details9">  Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah"s Apostle said, Whoever is made wealthy by Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his wealth will be made like a baldheaded poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes. The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say,I am your wealth, I am your treasure. Then the Prophet recited the holy verses:—Let not those who withhold . . . (to the end of the verse). (3.180).  </string>
    <string name="Details10">  Narrated Khalid bin Aslam: We went out with Abdullah bin Umar and bedouin said (to Abdullah), Tell me about Allah"s saying: And those who hoard up gold and silver (Al-Kanz - money, gold, silver etc., the Zakat of which has not been paid) and spend it out in the Way of Allah (V.9:34). Ibn Umar said, Whoever hoarded them and did not pay the Zakat thereof, then woe to him. But these holy Verses were revealed before the Verses of Zakat. So when the Verses of Zakat were revealed Allah made Zakat a purifier of the property. </string>


    <string name="Details11">  Narrated Abu Sa`id: Allah"s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, No Zakat is due on property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs. (A Wasqs equals 60 Sas) and (1 Sa=3 K gms App.) </string>
    <string name="Details12">  Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and asked him, What has brought you to this place? He said, I was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the Quran):They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.(9.34). Muawiya said,This verse is revealed regarding the people of the scriptures. I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the scriptures. So we had a quarrel and Muawiya sent a complaint against me to `Uthman. `Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to `Uthman who said to me, You may depart and live nearby if you wish. That was the reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him .  </string>
    <string name="Details13">  Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us and said, Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting. After saying that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said to him, I think the people disliked what you had said.  </string>
    <string name="Details14"> He said, These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me. I asked, Who is your friend? He said, The Prophet said (to me),O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud? And on that I (Abu Dhar) started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah"s Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said,Yes, He said,I do not love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah"s cause) except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth. No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.</string>
    <string name="Details15">  Narrated Ibn Mas`ud: I heard the Prophet saying, There is no envy except in two: a person whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a person whom Allah has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he gives his decisions accordingly and teaches it to the others.  </string>
    <string name="Details16">  Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah"s Apostle said, If one give in charity what equals one date-fruit from the honestly earned money and Allah accepts only the honestly earned money —Allah takes it in His right (hand) and then enlarges its reward for that person (who has given it), as anyone of you brings up his baby horse, so much s that it becomes as big as a mountain </string>
    <string name="Details17">  Narrated Haritha bin Wahab: I heard the Prophet saying, O people! Give in charity as a time will come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested to take it) will say, If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken it, but today I am not in need of it.  </string>
    <string name="Details18">  Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till your wealth increases so much so that one will be worried, for no one will accept his Zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, I am not in need of it. </string>
    <string name="Details19">  Narrated `Adi bin Hatim: While I was sitting with Allah"s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained about the prevalence of robberies. Allah"s Apostle said, As regards stealing and robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina) without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask him,Did not I give you wealth? He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further ask, Didn"t send a messenger to you? And again that person will reply in the affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if you do not find a hall datefruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </string>
    <string name="Details20">  Narrated Abu Musa: Thy Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, A time will come upon the people when a person will wander about with gold as Zakat and will not find anybody to accept it, and one man will be seen followed by forty women to be their guardian because of scarcity of men and great number of women.  </string>


    <string name="Details21">  Narrated Abu Mas`ud: When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they (the people) said, He is showing off. And another man came and gave a Sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, Allah is not in need of this small amount of charity. And then the Divine Inspiration came: Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them. (9.79).  </string>
    <string name="Details22">  Narrated Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari: Whenever Allah"s Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered us to give in charity, we used to go to the market and work as porters and get a Mudd (a special measure of grain) and then give it in charity. (Those were the days of poverty) and today some of us have one hundred thousand.  </string>
    <string name="Details23">  Narrated `Adi bin Hatim heard the Prophet saying: Save yourself from Hell-fire even by giving half a date-fruit in charity.  </string>
    <string name="Details24">  Narrated Aisha: A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for some alms), but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and she divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything herself, and then she got up and went away. Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story. He said, Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously (with benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire. (See Hadith No. 24, Vol. 8). </string>
    <string name="Details25">  Narrated Abu Huraira: A man came to the Prophet and asked, O Allah"s Apostle! Which charity is the most superior in reward? He replied, The charity which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say,Give so much to such and such, and so much to such and such. And it has already belonged to such and such (as it is too late).  </string>
    <string name="Details26">  Narrated `Aisha: Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, Who amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)? He said, Whoever has the longest hand. So they started measuring their hands with a stick and Sauda"s hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of all in the caliphate of `Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya).  </string>
    <string name="Details27">  Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah"s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, A man said that he would give something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object of charity to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, O Allah! All the praises are for you. I will give alms again. And so he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress last night. The man said, O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. I will give alms again. So he went out with his alms again and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next morning said that he had given his alms to a wealthy person. He said, O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man. Then someone came and said to him, The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson from it and spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah"s cause.  </string>
    <string name="Details28">  Narrated Maan bin Yazid: My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah"s Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. One day I went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had taken some gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought them to him (my father). My father said, By Allah! I did not intend to give them to you. I took (the case) to Allah"s Apostle . On that Allah"s Apostle said, O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you intended. O Man! Whatever you have taken is yours.  </string>
    <string name="Details29">  Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, Seven people will be shaded by Allah under His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His. They are: (1) a just ruler; (2) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, (i.e. worship Allah (Alone) sincerely from his childhood), (3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosque (who offers the five compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque); (4) two persons who love each other only for Allah"s sake and they meet and part in Allah's cause only; (5) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for an illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah; (6) a person who practices charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity). (7) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes get flooded with tears.  </string>
    <string name="Details30">  Narrated Haritha bin Wahab Al-Khuza`i: I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, (O people!)

One should start giving first to his dependents. And the best object of charity is that which is given by a wealthy person (from the money which is left after his expenses). And whoever abstains from asking others for some financial help, Allah will give him and save him from asking others, Allah will make him self-sufficient.  </string>
    <string name="Details34">  Narrated Ibn `Umar: I heard Allah"s Apostle (p.b.u.h) while he was on the pulpit speaking about charity, to abstain from asking others for some financial help and about begging others, saying, The upper hand is better than the lower hand.

    <string name="Details35">  Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith: Once the Prophet offered the `Asr prayer and then hurriedly went to his house and returned immediately.

    <string name="Details36">  Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet went out for the `Id prayer on the `Id day and offered a two rak`at prayer; and he neither offered a prayer before it or after it.

(The sub-narrator Sulaiman added that he said,The prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.) `Umar said,I did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea. I said, O chief of the believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it. He asked, Will the door be broken or opened?I replied,No, it will be broken He said,Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again? I replied,Yes.Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it. Hudhaifa said, The door was `Umar. We further asked Hudhaifa whether `Umar knew what that door meant. Hudhaifa replied in the affirmative and added, He knew it as one knows that there will be a night before the tomorrow morning.  </string>
